     * CCControl is inspired by the UIControl API class from the UIKit library of 
     * CocoaTouch. It provides a base class for control CCSprites such as CCButton 
     * or CCSlider that convey user intent to the application.
     *
     * The goal of CCControl is to define an interface and base implementation for 
     * preparing action messages and initially dispatching them to their targets when
     * certain events occur.
     *
     * To use the CCControl you have to subclass it.
